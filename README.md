# poetry-art-quines
A collection of poetry written in code, and other coded art or quines.

- I don't know how this will go. Its an idea I've held for a while, and have finally decided to start exploring.
The idea is to write poetry in syntactically correct programming languages (any will do). Poetic license allowed on syntax. ie the code doesnt have to run without error, but is intended to be read. Error messages may indeed form part of the humor or poetry.

- Art works can include ASCII art, or other works of code that result in visual artistic representations, for example by virtue of the formatting of the source code.

- Quines (defined as: a program which takes no input but outputs a copy of its own code.) also accepted as a form of coding art.

- Researching this idea led me to various sites, but I found [The Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U) presentation by [Dylan Beatie](https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie) (NDC London Feb 2020) intriguing. Clearly many others have had this though before me. Brief searches on [TED](https://www.ted.com/search?q=code+poetry) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=poetry+in+code) return several examples in the results.
